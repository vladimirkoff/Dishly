Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don't collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, i.e., no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration. We designed our systems not to have sensitive data about you; even when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.

LIMITED and its affiliates ("Lemon Clove," "we," "our" or "us") collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of our websites (including www.vpnmaster.co), services, and applications (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") does not apply to information you may process when using our Services.

                                                                                                        Our VPN APP is a non-obligatory log network. Lemon Clove are not available for the information related to the personal information of users, including but not limited to names (subscriber names, user names and screen names), addresses (including mailing addresses, residential address, business addresses) and telephones, unless the data you provide depending on the context of your interactions with us and the choices you make, including your privacy settings, and the products and features you use for the purpose of administering your subscription and for the purpose to enjoy our VPN services. Except for the limited exceptions, we don't automatically collect any Personal Information from you.
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        When you open the APP seeking for our VPN services, the APP assigns a unique identifier to you for the service (such unique identifier just binds up with your device identification code, but does not tie to any other personal information of users). When you use the VPN services, we will check your account information through this unique identifier to determine the level of service you have signed up for before establishing your VPN connection.

To understand what personal information the processor collects and stores, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy. Therefore, except for the limited exception above, we do not know any means or source of user's detailed payment for VPN services (including any credit card or bank account number) or any billing records either.

                                                                                                        Subject to applicable laws and for the avoidance to infringe any internet service provider, any browsing information, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, DNS queries or other similar information relating to your online activities transmitted by you to our servers is encrypted and cleared after the VPN "session" is closed.

More specifically, Lemon Clove has NO documents/information below under the situations of the limited connecting with your personal information and the non-collection of the websites you visit or any data stored on or transmitted from your device:
                                                                                                        * We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.

                                                                                                        If anyone would like to access to or try to compel Lemon Clove to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data don't exist.
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        For the purpose to fulfill our contractual obligations in good faith and to make you enjoy excellent VPN services, we collect the following information related to your VPN usage:

                                                                                                        We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated. It makes our Support Team efficiently find out and eliminate technical issues for you.

The minimal information allows us to provide efficient technical support to you, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to use our VPN services, and to enable our engineers to identify and fix network issues.
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        The Size (in MB) of Data transferred (but not any websites you visit or any data transmitted from your device)

It is one of our service principles to provide unlimited data transfer, however if we notice that a user occupies more traffic than thousands of others combined, what influence other users to enjoy high-quality service, we may seek for the reason with the user.
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        Anonymous Data for Network Diagnostics, Study and Analysis
                                                                                                        When you become one of our users for the VPN services, with yourpermission, we collect minimal usage statistics and anonymized analytics data used for network diagnostics in our network operations tools, for the purpose to optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems related to specific apps, VPN servers, or ISPs. Learning and analyzing the statistics allows us to improve the quality of the services and the products. We ensure the information we receive is fully anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual users (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store IP addresses).
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        We will collect the following information:
                                                                                                        - Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.
                                                                                                        - Speed test data.
                                                                                                        - Crash reports, also without any personally identifiable information. These are handled in an anonymized form by third parties, dependent on the platform you are using.

                                                                                                        We collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service. Although we provide service to users improving the network speed, we can't uniquely identify any specific behavior of any user, because thousands of users share one same location simultaneously to enjoy surfing the internet and the usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.

We never know HOW they have utilized our Service.

In service of this mission, Lemon Clove's registered place of business is in Singapore, where it has integrated data protection legislation.

The disclosure of personal data may follow this Privacy Policy.
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        Required by any foreign law enforcement agencies, Lemon Clove turns over protected user information only upon receipt of a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant, which shall be served effectively under the Rules of Court of Singapore. More specifically, we think the subpoena, court order, or search warrant may lose its coercive effect when it crosses its boundary. It only regains coercive effect on the other side of the line either through a domestication action (in the other state's courts) or under the authority of a statute. Additionally, we will notify affected users about any requests for their account information unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order. Should we receive a valid served legal order, it is important to note that Lemon Clove does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.

None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.

We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.

We would strongly urge parents to instruct their children never to disclose their real name, address, or telephone number while they are online without prior permission. Lemon Clove does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16, and children under 16 years old are prohibited from using our services. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, you can alert us at vpnproxymaster@inconnecting.com.

The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could inhibit our ability to comply with a legal obligation, inhibit our ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims, result in disclosure of personal information about a third party, or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to us or a third party.
